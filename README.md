A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Project Title: Custom printf
Description
This project is a custom implementation of the standard C printf function. It allows the user to print formatted output to the console by supporting various format specifiers such as %d, %i, %s, %c, and more. The goal of this project is to create a simplified version of the standard printf, which demonstrates an understanding of variable arguments, function pointers, and custom formatting.

Features
Custom implementation of printf using variable arguments (va_list, va_start, va_end).
Supports basic format specifiers: %d, %i, %c, %s, and %.
Uses function pointers to dynamically handle different format specifiers.
Returns the total number of characters printed.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
Basic knowledge of C programming, specifically with respect to:
Variadic functions
Function pointers
Handling format specifiers
